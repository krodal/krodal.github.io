# Who am I?  I am Kyle Rodal, and I am in a computer programming degree, I have also studied acting and assortment of other things, which do not pay the bills.  My favorite quote is 'Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth’ by John F Kennedy.  I say to others, life is too short to do what we need to do, so don’t waste a second of it.  Every day I try to find some time to do something productive which does not immediately need to be done, to better myself.  I also have two young adorable and all around wonderful nephew and niece, whom I love dearly!

## What do I like?  What I like does a better job at saying who I am, and who I am does a better job at saying what I like to do.  I enjoy reading an excessive number of news stories to damage my mental health, dancing to get exercise while performing an art, karaoke to sing, since I can’t sing.  Writing to get the voices out of my head, especial in the form of aphorism, so I have less work to do, and so that people will hear you before they find a way to escape, and acting to be someone more interesting than me.  Every morning I meditate as with all the things to stress out over in the day having a moment of clarity of your thoughts maintains a balance in our lives.

I decided to use the line breaks "<br>" since it keeps everything in the same header, and "&nbsp;" to indent the lines.   -->
